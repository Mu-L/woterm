## Module description
The client code has been completely open source(except for the kxver version control module), and the third-party code which comes from GitHub or CodeProject or other open communities. Some modules come from [WoVNC](http://wovnc.com).

## WoVNCServer
[WoVNCServer](http://www.wovnc.com) is recommended, The server enables more advanced features.
